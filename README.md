# Fashion_mnist
#Overview
This project focuses on building a fashion recognition system using the Fashion MNIST dataset. Fashion MNIST is a dataset containing 28x28 grayscale images of fashion items, such as shirts, trousers, dresses, and shoes. The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify these fashion items.

#Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of fashion items across 10 different classes. Each image is labeled with the corresponding class it belongs to. The dataset is preprocessed and normalized to ensure consistent input for the model.

#Model Architecture
The fashion recognition model is built using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework. The architecture of the model typically consists of one or more convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. Techniques like dropout and batch normalization may be used to improve model performance and prevent overfitting.
